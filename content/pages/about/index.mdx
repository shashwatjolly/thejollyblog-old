Hi!

Shashwat Jolly is currently a final year undergrad student at IIT Guwahati. He lives in NCR, when he's not busy surviving college. He's an upcoming Software Developer at Microsoft, Redmond and is very passionate about technology (and procrastinating). Like all people in early twenties, he's still figuring out life. But he's really interested in working on real-world solutions which truly affect society positively. 

Do reach out for anything you might want to say. He loves random conversations :)
